>Postal is a private sharing social service, learning from the postal elements in the real world. It is designed to be anti-excessive-sharing, and only have one-to-one communication between users and all the journals are private for the user self. Users send postal to each other and keep journals as notes, videos, images, audios and web parts.

>- We wish friends to have a longer connection.
>- We wish moments to be taken as memories.
>- We wish sharing be and only be an expression of miss.
>- We wish journals to be kept to to yourself.

>As for the Android team, we choose Geak Watch II to be the device supported by Postal. The device carries Android 4.3 and sells well over the world. The logics here are similar to that on Apple Watch.
